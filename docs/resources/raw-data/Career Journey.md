So before we start sharpening my resumes, I think I should share some more insight about my career with you.

Here is a write up about my 10+ years of work experience and journey so far:

# Early Days:
My work experience started right from my under-grad college days back when I was pursuing my B.Tech in Computer Science, in my second year (2014), me a close friend / class mate (Saurav) started working freelance for web development. We would have clients for whom we would develop landing pages and static websites like portfolios and corporate websites, given the shift of the marketing, web development started  naturally drifting towards eCommerce and so did our clientele and projects. 

# Career kick-start - Entrepreneurship
## TECHNOTRONIC
We formed a company called "TECHNOTRONIC" to formally taking on such projects and started building our team.  to deliver projects for clients across Delhi-NCR, Mumbai, Gujarat, UAE, UK and US. Projects ranging across platforms and technologies such as custom development, WordPress, WooCommerce, Magento, Shopify, PrestaShop, OpenCart, mobile apps, etc., for corporates and eCommerce driven projects.

## D2C Journey - RigAssembler
On the other hand, less an a year into our journey, an idea pop-ed up to create our own eCommerce website. We saw a gap between the offerings from mainstream desktop OEM brands such as DELL, HP, Lenovo, etc. and the upper-tier custom built hardware rig demands for the professionals such as games, streamer (something that had very recently started pick up some steam in India), CAD & graphics designers, scientific work flows such as protein simulations, etc. While boutique builders such as Puget,  MainGear, and later several others were picking up steam in the western markets at that time, in India, we still lacked a consulted, highly specialized boutique PC builder. So we created "RigAssembler", a sister-concern / brand of TECHNOTRONIC and shifted our corporate office to Nehru Place, Delhi, hired teams and started building our own D2C brand.

# Next Chapter - Corporate life - GreenHonchos
TECHNOTRONIC & RigAssembler did business between 2014 to the end of 2019. Starting 2020 I joined this company "GreenHonchos" that did D2C ennoblement in all forms of service lanes such as Technology (web & app development), Marketing, SEO, Marketplace management, etc. Back then GH was a less than 40 member organization that worked for multiple brands in India. My experience and expertise were exactly what they were looking for (some to lead product development, manage projects and help lead multiple aspects of the tech department). And so I did.

## Time at GH
### Product Management (Product Development)
#### 1. KartXO - 2020
- KartXO was meant to be a spring board for Small to Mid D2C businesses, focused on India specific features (OTP based login, advance filters, search features, etc., for customers | DIY store moderation and easy expansion for brands).
- It was still a speak of dusk in the organization's eye but with no-one to lead the product in-house and our CTO was caught up with department's operations and PNL responsibilities, while the rest of the team lacked product-focused spark. But now that I had joined, I was straight away given the responsibility to lead the development of the product.
- And Product development is what I did, and I did it fully independently (so I was the backend, frontend, DevOps, manager and everything in between). I also held progress meetings with the stakeholders (CTO, CEO, & other Board members).
- In about 3 months, our first version was ready to hit productions and so I was tasked with implementation of my own product.
- Then for about the next 6 months, I lead the implementation of KartXO (this time I had a small 1-2 member team) for large retail brands such as Maspar and D2C first brands such as MarcaDisati, Artistico, among many others. All the implementations went successful and generated the expected revenue for the brands.
	
#### 2. KartmaX - Late 2020 and beyond
- KartmaX had already existed as a enterprise product which was in parallel development to KartXO but with a key deference being that it was meant for enterprise brands.
- With features such as microservice, al-a-carte, plug-n-play architecture | headless frontend, highly available and highly scalable | Deep integrations with third party ecosystem such as payment gateways, third party logistics | and a lot of emphasis on analytics, it truly was one with a bigger team involved in developing and deploying it for enterprise grade brands such as TCNS, V2 Retail, etc.
- But the dreams with KartmaX (KX) were even bigger, GH wanted truly omni-channel commerce ennoblement with the platform. They wanted marketplace capabilities, hyper local commerce, vendor and settlement management / automation systems. All this while the enterprise were finally getting serious about this eCommerce thing after the first wave of COVID shutting their brick-and-mortar stores for long stretches while the Indian consumer was getting more and accustomed to buying from platforms other than the traditional marketplaces such as Flipkart and Amazon. It was the perfect timing after all, but then they faced the same challenge, who would spearhead all of this product development and then delivery? - Me, it was me of course, again :)

##### So I was now tasks to build the following "Flavors of KartmaX"
1. **Marketplace** 
	- Capability to on board multiple vendors on the site and allowing each vendor to list & sell their products on the platform
	- Settlement Calculation, settlement wallet and payouts - All fully automated based on the Vendor's sales, payment charging, delivery costs & platform commissions.
	- Seller rating
	- Capability for the customer to view and buy same products from multiple listings of each seller by comparing pricing and seller rating.
	- Capability to combine items from multiple sellers into a single shipment / multiple depending on factors such as the volume of the goods and capacity of the rider.
2. **Omni-channel**
	- Linking multiple inventory locations of the brands (stores, warehouses, etc.) to enable features such as:
		- Fulfilment from store
		- Return to store
3. **Hyperlocal**
	- Creating a geo-fenced store based on the customer's location and all the outlets with the servable radius of the customer.
	- Enabling 2 hour delivery within close proximity.

### Project Management (Product Implementation)
#### Early Years (2014 to 2020)
- During my time at TECHNOTRONIC as an Entrepreneur, I led multiple projects with my teams across technologies, some of platform included:
	- Custom Development
	- WordPress / WooCommerce
	- Shopify
	- Magento
	- PrestaShop
- I led the project development, stakeholder management, milestones and project closures.
- I delivered more than 50 projects of all shapes and sizes across corporates, portfolios & eCommerce domains and regions such as Delhi, India, UAE, UK and US.
#### KartXO Implementations (2020)
- After the core development of the first version of the KartXO platform, I delivered 6 implementations for brands such as **Maspar**, **MarcaDisati**, **Artistico**, etc. 
- I led the project development, stakeholder management, milestones and project closures.
#### KartmaX Implementations (2020 to 2023)
- As I was working with my team to develop all the various Flavors of KartmaX, in parallel I was also task some some enterprise level implementation of standard D2C KartmaX (which was already in existence)
- This included nationalized brands such as **Mochi Shoes**, **Popular Shoe Mart** among others.
- I was then also tasked with the implementation of all the above mentioned flavors of KartmaX for platforms like **WNWD** (digitization of malls and brick-n-mortar stores), **ExpressStores** (2 hr. grocery delivery service with 100+ retail and dark stores) and **Inorbit** (digitization of Inorbit malls by Raheja Group)
- I led the project development, stakeholder management, milestones and project closures.

These were just few & marquee projects that I took on during my GreenHonchos where I my career of 5+ years I have so far delivered more than 40 projects on KartmaX, some of them are **Metro Shoes**, **FitFlop**, **Ecco**, **William Penn**, **Being Human**, **Siyaram's**, **Sleepwell**, **Sabhyata** and many more.

### Pre-sales Solutioning (2021+)
- The reputation of our organization grew and we started engaging with more and more prospects for their eCom tech requirements in 2021, meantime the our primary solution architect (our then CTO) was tasked with other responsibilities and urgencies, so there was a clear need to help the sales team land
- Someone must have said, "hey, what about that kid who seems to do anything and everything, why don't we let me give it a shot?"
- Of course I had done this all this during my Entrepreneurship days as I was the one closing all the sales back then as well so it was a natural fit for me.
- Our new sales head had joined and together with him and the rest of the sales team.
- I continue to serve the functional head for all pre-sales solutioning work at GH and I have standardized / formalized the solutioning approach and documentation such as:
	- Pre-Proposal Questionnaire
	- Project Phasing / Work Breakdown Schedule / Project Charter
	- Scope of Work Proposal
	- Cost Structures, Models and Payment Milestones
	- Gap-Fit Document
	- Support Proposal
	- Warranty Support
- For platforms such as:
	- KartmaX
	- Shopify / Shopify Plus
	- Magento / Enterprise
	- Mobile Apps (iOS & Android)
- I cut down on leakages due to long solutioning TATs, scope creep, lack of market fit costings & offerings.
- I helped closed brand like **Victoria's Secret**, **Philips**, **THE One**, **PAN Homes**, **Metro Shoes**, **Being Human** and many more.

### Consulting & CRO (2022+)
- By 2022 the eCom market was a lot more matured (unlike the 2020 COVID time) and a lot of dust was settled, large brands already had well established eCommerce practices.
- But as GH, we saw a need for not for the implementing and productization in eCom (there were already tons of SIs and products in the market) but a need for the SMEs to help brands leverage existing tools to achieve things like **optimizing on their ROI / RoAS**, **scaling operations**, smartly getting more out of what they already had.
- This lead to the birth of **Ascent framework** which was an extensive system of measuring each and every key touchpoint of the customer journey from their interaction & experience of the website to each and every step of checkout journey. It involved keeping an eye on the all the key systems, integrations and their health metrics but also comparing all the number to the historical graphs and industry trends.
- I consulted extensively with the likes of **Apparel Group** for their big name brands such as **Bath & Body Works** and achieved solid CRO (conversion rate optimization) results:
	- 30% Increase in overall eCommerce conversion
	- 14% Increase in add-to-cart rate
	- 1.5% Increase conversion rate increased
- I led the implementation of the world's largest lingerie brand - **Victoria's Secret** on Salesforce Commerce Cloud for Apparel Group in India, as the **Consulting Project Manager** for the brand in a nearly 10 month long implementation roadmap.
- I continue to audit and consult for our brand at GH to this day.

### Project Management Office (PMO) (2023+)
As a part of the Program Management Office at GreenHonchos. Optimization around the following areas was my KRA:
- **Client Success & Relationship Management**: 
	- Beyond project management, I worked to nurture strong client relationships. 
	- With a keen understanding of our client's needs and objectives, I tailor solutions that align with their unique requirements. Ensuring the achievement of client goals and lasting partnerships. This was an extended role beyond KartmaX. 
	- I was now a major escalation point at GH for any enterprise implementation across technologies (including Magento Enterprise & Shopify Plus).
- **Driving Process Improvements**:
	- By implementing experience-backed insights and best practices; streamlining workflows, bolstering productivity, and optimizing resource allocation for maximum efficiency.
	- Things like implementing **KRA matrix** for all role involved in projects, **frameworks for project transitioning** from sales to solutions to implementation, **project milestone standardization**, **project phasing** & relevant **documentation**, **resource allocation planning** among others were some of the workflows and operations where I brought optimizations.
- **Guiding Through Roadblocks**: I supported teams in overcoming challenges and roadblocks. Whether they are technical or non-technical in nature.

### Region Expansion (2024+)
- By the end of 2023, GH had already been established as one of the major eCommerce partners in the industry, however, our footprint was largely limited to India.
- But the organization had always wanted to extend to other regions and particularly the Meddle East (GCC) for a. the new challenges that come with a new region, b. our established expertise in the eCom space, and c. for the potential larger projects and and quality of revenue.
- And so it began, when I help close the digital transformation for "THE One" our one of the largest project yet with a legacy & household name brand from the region having it's presence in all the major GCC countries (UAE, Qatar, Kuwait, Bahrain, Jordon). A need to completely re-imagine their eCommerce with Omni-channel enablement.
- From there I was posted in Dubai as one of the 2 team members leading the charge to not only deliver projects like "THE One" (which I did) but to also support the sales efforts with solid solutioning and pitching to new prospects.
- I also played the role of a CSM, making sure that all our GCC accounts got the at most care and more from the delivery teams back in India.
- I continue to help expand GH's presence in the GCC having spent more than a year in the region, getting to understand the nexus & dynamics of the business community in one of the most developed nations of the world.
