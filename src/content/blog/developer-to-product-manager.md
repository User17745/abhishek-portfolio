When I was asked to build KartXO as a solo developer, I didn't realize I was also becoming a product manager. Looking back, that experience shaped my entire approach to building software products.

## The Challenge

In 2020, GreenHonchos needed a platform for SMB D2C brands. We had KartmaX for enterprise clients, but nothing for smaller businesses. The mandate was simple: build something in 3 months.

## What I Did Wrong

### 1. Started Building Too Soon

I jumped straight into code without talking to potential users. Rookie mistake. I built features I *thought* were important rather than what users actually needed.

### 2. Over-engineered the First Version

I spent weeks building a flexible architecture that could handle any use case. The reality? Our first 5 clients needed the same basic features. I wasted time on flexibility we didn't need yet.

### 3. Ignored Documentation

"I'll document it later" became a running joke. Six months later, I was struggling to remember why I made certain decisions.

## What I Did Right

### 1. Shipped Fast

Despite the missteps, I delivered the MVP in 3 months. A shipped imperfect product beats a perfect product that never launches.

### 2. Listened to Early Users

Once we had clients on the platform, I spent hours on calls understanding their pain points. This feedback directly shaped the next versions.

### 3. Built for the Indian Market

Features like OTP login, UPI payments, and COD support were specific to Indian consumers. This localization was a key differentiator.

## The Product Manager Mindset

The transition from "how do I build this?" to "should we build this?" is the core of product management. Key questions I learned to ask:

- What problem are we solving?
- For whom are we solving it?
- How will we measure success?
- What's the minimum viable solution?

## Lessons for Developers

If you're a developer looking to grow:

1. **Talk to users** - It's uncomfortable at first, but invaluable
2. **Embrace constraints** - They force focus and creativity
3. **Ship incrementally** - Don't wait for perfection
4. **Write it down** - Your future self will thank you

The best product managers I know have technical backgrounds. Understanding what's possible helps you make better decisions about what's valuable.
