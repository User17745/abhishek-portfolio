  bio: `I've spent the last decade building, scaling, and fixing digital commerce platforms. Started as a developer, became a founder, and now lead enterprise transformations across the Middle East and India.

Currently based in Dubai, I head GreenHonchos' expansion across the GCC — helping brands like THE One, Victoria's Secret, and Philips launch and scale their digital presence.

Whether it's architecting a SaaS platform from scratch, optimizing conversion rates by 30%, or managing multi-country rollouts — I've done it.`,
