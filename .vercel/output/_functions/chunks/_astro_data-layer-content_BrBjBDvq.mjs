Hypothesis Development\n\nBased on the audit, we create prioritized hypotheses using the PIE framework:\n- **Potential**: How much improvement can we expect?\n- **Importance**: How valuable is this traffic?\n- **Ease**: How difficult is the implementation?\n\n### 3. Testing & Validation\n\nEvery change is tested with:\n- A/B tests for high-traffic pages\n- Multivariate tests for complex changes\n- User recordings and heatmaps for qualitative insights\n\n### 4.
